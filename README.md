# BEET API
### Under Construction

My first api, used for a little project at work. 

# START
### 1. Install NPM
`npm install`

<i>All dependencies from package.json will be installed</i>

### 2. Install CORS
`npm install --save CORS`

<i>CORS policy</i>

### 3. Install Mongoose
`npm install --save mongoose`

<i>With Mongoose we'll have a translator for the database to JS objects so they can be used by the application.</i>

### 4. Running with *nodemon*
`nodemon app.js`
